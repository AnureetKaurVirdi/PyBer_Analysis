# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview:

The purpose of this project is to analyze ride-sharing data. Also, through this process, different types of visualizations will be used to aid the analysis of the data. These charts would be used to showcase the relationship between the type of city, number of drivers and riders as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by the type of city. This analysis and report will help PyBer to improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results:

### After performing all the analyses, the results are as follows:

1.	The total number of drivers in the rural area is 78, who completed 125 rides for an average fare per ride of $34.62, which adds up to $4,300 (approx.) in total fares. In a rural city, each driver earns an average fare of $55.49, and the riders are charged $34.62, which is the highest average fare per ride.
2.	There are 490 drivers in a suburban city, who completed 625 rides to amount to a total fare of $19,000 (approx.). In a suburban city, a driver receives $39.50, which is less compared to rural drivers. But the riders are charged less in suburban cities because the average fare per ride is $30.97 for suburban cities. 
3.	Finally, the maximum number of rides are completed in urban cities, which are 1,625 rides by 2,405 drivers, which is also the maximum number of drivers as compared to rural and suburban cities. In urban cities, the drivers earn the least amount of average fare per driver, which is $16.57, and the riders are charged $24.53, which is the cheapest average fare per ride. 

## Summary/Recommendations to CEO:

Encourage more drivers in rural and suburban areas, so that the average fare per ride is affordable for the residents. Introduce minimum pay rate for active drivers, so that they do not fear entering the market because of competition and give incentives to drivers who drive full-time or complete a certain number of rides in one day.
